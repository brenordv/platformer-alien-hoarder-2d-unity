# Alien Hoarder 2D

This a simple platformer game with only one level and the goal is to reach the Exit sign.
You score points by collecting gems. 
Avoid enemies! If they touch you, you die!

This was my attempt to work with animations, creating different enemies and working with tilemaps to create traps.

# About platformer games
The term platform game emerged in the years following the release of the first established title in the genre, Donkey Kong (1981), though its exact origin is unknown. Shigeru Miyamoto originally called Donkey Kong a "running/jumping/climbing game" while developing it.[6] Miyamoto commonly used the term "athletic game" to refer to Donkey Kong and later games in the genre, such Super Mario Bros. (1985).[7][8]

Donkey Kong spawned a number of other titles with a mix of running, jumping, and vertical traversal, a novel genre that did not match the style of games that came before it, leaving journalists and writers to offer their own terms.[9] Computer and Video Games magazine, among others, referred to the genre as "Donkey Kong-type" or "Kong-style" games.[9][10] "Climbing games" was used in Steve Bloom's 1982 book Video Invaders and 1983 magazines Electronic Games (US) and TV Gamer (UK).[11][12][13] Bloom defined "climbing games" as titles where the player "must climb from the bottom of the screen to the top while avoiding and/or destroying the obstacles and foes you invariably meet along the way." Under this definition, he listed Space Panic (1980), Donkey Kong and Frogger (1981) as climbing games.
